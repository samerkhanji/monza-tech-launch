# ðŸš— How to Upload All 117 Vehicles to Monza TECH

## ðŸ“‹ What This Will Do
- Add **77 new vehicles** to your existing 40 vehicles
- Include complete warranty tracking information
- Set proper status and floor locations
- Total: **117 vehicles** in your database

## ðŸŽ¯ Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Open Supabase Dashboard
- Go to [https://supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
- Sign in to your account
- Select your Monza TECH project

### 2. Open SQL Editor
- In the left sidebar, click **"SQL Editor"**
- Click **"New query"** to create a new SQL script

### 3. Copy and Paste the SQL
- Copy the entire contents of `final-117-vehicles-upload.sql`
- Paste it into the SQL Editor
- Click **"Run"** button

### 4. Verify the Upload
- The script will show you:
  - Current database state (40 records)
  - Final database state (117 records)
  - Breakdown by status and floor location

## âœ… Expected Results
After running the script, you should see:
- **Total records: 117** (instead of 40)
- **Status breakdown**: All vehicles marked as 'sold'
- **Floor breakdown**: Mix of 'Delivered' and 'Available' vehicles

## ðŸ”„ Refresh Your App
- Go back to your Monza TECH application
- Navigate to **Car Inventory** page
- You should now see **"Car Inventory (117)"** instead of **"Car Inventory (40)"**

## ðŸš¨ If You Get Errors
- **Duplicate VIN errors**: The script uses `ON CONFLICT (vin) DO NOTHING` to handle this
- **Column errors**: Make sure you're using the `car_inventory` table (not `cars`)
- **Permission errors**: Check that your Supabase user has INSERT permissions

## ðŸ“ž Need Help?
If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the error message in Supabase
2. Verify you're in the correct project
3. Make sure you're using the `car_inventory` table

## ðŸŽ‰ Success!
Once completed, your Monza TECH app will display all 117 vehicles with complete warranty tracking information!
