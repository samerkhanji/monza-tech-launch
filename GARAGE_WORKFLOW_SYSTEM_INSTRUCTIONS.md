# 🔧 GARAGE WORKFLOW SYSTEM - TESTING INSTRUCTIONS

## **✅ What I Implemented**

A comprehensive garage workflow system where:
1. **Cars in garage are ONLY shown in garage schedule** (not in other inventories)
2. **When work is completed**, employees can choose where to move the car
3. **Status can be set to**: In Stock, Reserved, or Sold
4. **Client information is required** for reserved/sold cars
5. **Work notes are recorded** for tracking

## **🎯 How the Workflow Works**

### **Step 1: Car Goes to Garage**
- When a car is moved to "Garage", it's automatically added to the garage schedule
- The car disappears from other inventory pages (Showroom, Inventory, etc.)
- It only appears in the Garage Schedule page

### **Step 2: Work is Completed**
- In Garage Schedule, click "Complete Work" button on any car
- This opens the Garage Workflow Manager dialog

### **Step 3: Choose Destination & Status**
- **Select Destination**: Showroom Floor 1, Showroom Floor 2, Inventory, or Inventory Floor 2
- **Select Status**: In Stock, Reserved, or Sold
- **Add Client Info**: Required for Reserved/Sold cars
- **Add Work Notes**: Optional notes about completed work

### **Step 4: Complete Workflow**
- Car is moved to selected destination
- Status is updated
- Car appears in the appropriate inventory page
- Car is removed from garage schedule
- Activity log is created

4. **Click "Complete Work"**

### **Step 4: Verify Results**
