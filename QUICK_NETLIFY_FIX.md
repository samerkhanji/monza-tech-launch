# ðŸš€ QUICK NETLIFY FIX - Alternative Approach

## ðŸŽ¯ **Option 1: Use Different Repository**

Since the uploads keep timing out, let's try:

1. **In Netlify, try selecting a different repository**
2. **Look for any other repository you have that might work**
3. **Or create a new test repository**

## ðŸŽ¯ **Option 2: Manual Upload (Fastest)**

1. **In Netlify, instead of "New site from Git"**
2. **Choose "Deploy manually"**
3. **We'll build locally and upload the `dist` folder**

## ðŸŽ¯ **Option 3: Skip Netlify for Now**

1. **Focus on GitHub Pages first** (simpler setup)
2. **Come back to Netlify later**

## ðŸš€ **RECOMMENDED: Try GitHub Pages First**

GitHub Pages is easier and doesn't require the repository to be fully synced:

1. **Go to**: `https://github.com/samerkhanji/monza-tech-launch`
2. **Click**: "Settings" tab
3. **Scroll to**: "Pages" section
4. **Source**: Select "GitHub Actions"
5. **Done!**

This should work even if the repository sync is having issues.
