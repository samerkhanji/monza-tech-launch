# 🗄️ Database Structure - Supabase Only (No localStorage)

## Overview
This project now uses **Supabase database only** for all car management operations. All localStorage usage has been removed and replaced with proper database tables.

## 📁 Database Files Structure

```
src/database/
├── Floor1Table.ts          # Showroom Floor 1 operations
├── Floor2Table.ts          # Showroom Floor 2 operations  
├── CarInventoryTable.ts    # Main car inventory operations
├── GarageScheduleTable.ts  # Garage scheduling operations
├── OrderedCarsTable.ts     # Customer order operations
├── GarageInventoryTable.ts # Garage inventory operations
├── DatabaseManager.ts      # Main coordinator for all tables
└── test-database.ts        # Test functions for verification
```

## 🏗️ Database Tables

### 1. **Floor1Table** - Showroom Floor 1
- **Purpose**: Manages cars displayed on Showroom Floor 1
- **Key Methods**:
  - `getAllCars()` - Get all cars on Floor 1
  - `getCarCount()` - Get count of cars on Floor 1
  - `addCar(carId, notes)` - Move car to Floor 1
  - `removeCar(carId)` - Remove car from Floor 1
  - `clearAllCars()` - Clear all cars from Floor 1

### 2. **Floor2Table** - Showroom Floor 2
- **Purpose**: Manages cars displayed on Showroom Floor 2
- **Key Methods**: Same as Floor1Table but for Floor 2

### 3. **CarInventoryTable** - Main Inventory
- **Purpose**: Manages cars in main inventory (not on showroom floors)
- **Key Methods**:
  - `getAllCars()` - Get all cars in main inventory
  - `getCarCount()` - Get count of cars in inventory
  - `getTotalCarCount()` - Get total count of all cars
  - `moveCar(carId, destination, notes)` - Move car to another location
  - `searchCars(searchTerm)` - Search cars by criteria

### 4. **GarageScheduleTable** - Garage Scheduling
- **Purpose**: Manages car service scheduling
- **Key Methods**:
  - `getAllScheduledCars()` - Get all scheduled cars
  - `getScheduledCarCount()` - Get count of scheduled cars
  - `addCarToSchedule(carData, notes)` - Add car to schedule
  - `removeCarFromSchedule(scheduleId)` - Remove car from schedule

### 5. **GarageInventoryTable** - Garage Operations
- **Purpose**: Manages cars in garage for service/PDI
- **Key Methods**:
  - `getAllCars()` - Get all cars in garage
  - `getCarCount()` - Get count of cars in garage
  - `addCar(carId, notes)` - Move car to garage
  - `markPDICompleted(carId, technician, notes)` - Mark PDI as done

### 6. **OrderedCarsTable** - Customer Orders
- **Purpose**: Manages customer car orders
- **Key Methods**:
  - `getAllOrderedCars()` - Get all customer orders
  - `getOrderedCarCount()` - Get count of orders
  - `addCarOrder(carData, customerInfo)` - Create new order
  - `updateOrderStatus(orderId, newStatus)` - Update order status

## 🎯 DatabaseManager - Main Coordinator

The `DatabaseManager` class provides a clean interface to all tables:

```typescript
// Get counts from all locations
const counts = await DatabaseManager.getAllCounts();

// Move a car between locations
const success = await DatabaseManager.moveCar(carId, 'floor1', 'Moving to showroom');

// Get cars from specific location
const floor1Cars = await DatabaseManager.getFloor1Cars();
const garageCars = await DatabaseManager.getGarageCars();
```

## 🔄 How Car Movement Works

1. **Car Inventory** → **Floor 1/Floor 2**: Updates `current_floor` to 'Showroom 1' or 'Showroom 2'
2. **Car Inventory** → **Garage**: Updates `current_floor` to 'Garage'
3. **Car Inventory** → **Garage Schedule**: Updates `current_floor` to 'Garage' AND adds entry to `garage_schedule` table

## 📊 Expected Data Flow

```
Car Inventory (117 cars)
    ↓
Move Car Action
    ↓
Destination Selection:
├── Floor 1 → current_floor = 'Showroom 1'
├── Floor 2 → current_floor = 'Showroom 2'  
├── Garage → current_floor = 'Garage'
└── Garage Schedule → current_floor = 'Garage' + schedule entry
```

## 🧪 Testing the Database

Use the test function in browser console:

```javascript
// Test all database operations
await testDatabaseTables();

// Test specific operations
const counts = await DatabaseManager.getAllCounts();
console.log('Current counts:', counts);
```

## 🚀 Benefits of New Structure

1. **✅ No localStorage**: All data is persistent in Supabase
2. **✅ Real-time**: Data updates immediately across all pages
3. **✅ Scalable**: Can handle thousands of cars efficiently
4. **✅ Reliable**: Database transactions ensure data integrity
5. **✅ Organized**: Clear separation of concerns by table
6. **✅ Maintainable**: Easy to add new features and fix bugs

## 🔧 Usage Examples

### Moving a Car
```typescript
import { DatabaseManager } from '@/database/DatabaseManager';

// Move car to Floor 1
const success = await DatabaseManager.moveCar('car-123', 'floor1', 'Customer requested display');

if (success) {
  console.log('Car moved successfully!');
} else {
  console.log('Failed to move car');
}
```

### Getting Counts
```typescript
const counts = await DatabaseManager.getAllCounts();
console.log(`
  Inventory: ${counts.inventory}
  Floor 1: ${counts.floor1}
  Floor 2: ${counts.floor2}
  Garage: ${counts.garage}
  Scheduled: ${counts.scheduled}
  Ordered: ${counts.ordered}
`);
```

## 📝 Notes

- **All pages now load from Supabase**: No more localStorage data loading
- **Real-time updates**: When you move a car, it appears immediately in destination
- **Data consistency**: All operations go through the database for reliability
- **Performance**: Efficient queries with proper indexing on `current_floor` field

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test the system**: Move 1 car and verify it appears in destination
2. **Verify counts**: Check that Car Inventory decreases and destination increases
3. **Monitor console**: Look for DatabaseManager logs showing successful operations
4. **Report issues**: If problems occur, check browser console for error messages

**The system is now fully database-driven and should work exactly as expected!** 🎉
