# 🚀 Monza TECH - Distribution Guide

## 📦 Your Downloadable Software is Ready!

Your Monza TECH application has been successfully converted into a downloadable desktop application with licensing control.

### 🎯 What You Have Now

✅ **Standalone Desktop Application** - Located in `dist-electron/win-unpacked/`
✅ **License Verification System** - Only authorized users can run the app
✅ **Owner Authentication** - Built-in login system for owner verification
✅ **Offline Capable** - Runs without internet (with some online features via Supabase)

## 📍 Distribution Package Location

Your ready-to-distribute application is in:
```
dist-electron/win-unpacked/
├── Monza TECH.exe          ← Main application executable
├── license.key             ← License file (required for app to run)
├── resources/              ← App resources
└── [other Electron files]  ← Runtime dependencies
```

## 🔐 License Control System

### How It Works:
1. **License Required**: The app checks for `license.key` on startup
2. **Encrypted License**: Each license contains client info and expiry date
3. **No License = No Access**: App will show error and close without valid license

### For You (License Creator):
```bash
# Generate a new license for a client
node create-sample-license.js

# Or use the full generator (when fixed):
node generate-license.js "Client Name" "client@email.com" 12
```

### For Your Clients:
1. Receive the application folder from you
2. Must have valid `license.key` file in the app directory
3. App verifies license on every startup

## 🚀 Distribution Steps

### 1. **Prepare Distribution Package**
```bash
# Copy the entire win-unpacked folder
cp -r dist-electron/win-unpacked/ "Monza-TECH-v1.0"

# Create a license for the specific client
node create-sample-license.js

# Replace the license.key with client-specific license
```

### 2. **For Each Client**
- Create unique license: `node generate-license.js "Client Business Name" "client@email.com" 12`
- Copy application folder to client
- Include their specific `license.key`
- Provide installation instructions

### 3. **Client Installation**
1. Extract/copy the application folder
2. Ensure `license.key` is in the same folder as `Monza TECH.exe`
3. Run `Monza TECH.exe`
4. Login with owner credentials:
   - **Samer**: `samer@monzasal.com` / `Monza123`
   - **Houssam**: `houssam@monza.com` / `Monza123`
   - **Kareem**: `kareem@monza.com` / `Monza123`

## 🔒 Security Features

### ✅ **What's Protected:**
- **License Verification**: App won't run without valid license
- **Expiry Control**: Licenses can have expiration dates
- **Owner Authentication**: Login system for authorized access
- **Navigation Restriction**: Prevents external URL navigation

### ⚠️ **Important Notes:**
- Each client needs their own license file
- License files are tied to expiry dates
- App requires both license AND login for full access
- Keep your license generation script secure
