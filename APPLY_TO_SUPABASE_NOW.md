## What You Need to Do

### 1. **First: Apply Original Schema**
If you haven't applied the main schema yet:
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/wunqntfreyezylvbzvxc/sql
2. Copy the **entire contents** of `monza-complete-schema.sql`

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/wunqntfreyezylvbzvxc/sql
2. Copy the **entire contents** of `supabase-profiles-and-rls-update.sql`
3. Paste and click **"Run"**

### 3. **Verify Everything is Working**
Run this query in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Check all tables exist
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN (
  'cars', 'profiles', 'threads', 'thread_messages', 'pdi_inspections', 
  'test_drives', 'car_software_logs', 'car_customs_logs',
  'financial_entries', 'crm_contacts', 'crm_interactions',
  'marketing_activities', 'business_calendar', 'audit_log'
);
```

You should see **13 tables** (including the new `profiles` table).
